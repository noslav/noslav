### Who am I?

🕵️‍♂️ Reasoning from fundamentals is critical for impactful research. My formative years were spent in deep fondness (and study) of physics and engineering. Eventually getting to apply these as a plasma physicist focussed on nuclear fusion reactors and engineering (applied) physics at the max planck institute of plasma physics in Germany was a personal milestone.

🇪🇺 Appreciating and accommodating perspectives, cultures and languages is key to building trust. I learnt this from spending over 8 years in my 20's working, studying and traveling in over 45 countries across 5 different continents.

🙋‍♂️ Actions speak louder then words. I learnt this from building my own startups and projects (data science, ml, blockchain) from scratch, either failing and shutting down or succeeding and scaling up.

☯️ Patterns are embedded everywhere while disciplinary boundaries only arbitrary. I learnt this from engaging extensively across a variety of subjects including but not limited to history, economics, religion, biology, philosophy, anthropology, mathematics, neuroscience, complexity, music and spirituality hence, I aim to learn something new everyday.

🪬 Knowledge builds up exponentially over time with experience. As humans we aim to live in tune with our surroundings, experience a variety of situations and push beyond our comfort zone. To grow the knowledge that can help others better any experience gathered to this aim is never lost as we are always standing on the shoulders of giants.

🎢 Knowing the why enables facing the how. To continually work in the web3 space one must embrace its ethos for openness, decentralization, democratization of knowledge, resources and capital. This is the next quantum leap in making the world a more inclusive place for all.

✨ The Universe is a magical paradox. Education, reasoning, knowledge and experience only lead us to deeper and larger unresolved questions with complicated intertwined answers. This doesn't alter the fact that the universe is not a problem to be solved but a gift to be lived.

### What do I do?

👨‍💻 Senior decentralized ledger technology and distributed systems engineer with a proven product adoption record, strong research fundamentals (former physicist/data scientist) & an entrepreneurial mindset based in Vancouver, Canada 🇨🇦. I enjoy developing secure, scalable web3 products & infrastructure leveraging applied cryptography protocols and have a knack for sharing technical insights with experts & non-experts alike. I previously worked in software engineering projects based in Germany 🇩🇪 within various sectors - SaaS, Fintech, AI and Crypto for companies like [upvest.co](https://upvest.co), [joinef.com](https://upvest.co), [ost.com](https://github.com/OpenST) and [freshworks.com](https://www.freshworks.com).

🔗 Current expertise is in working extensively with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains leveraging Golang / Elixir / Node (JS/TS) / Python / Solidity / Docker / GCP / Linux.

### What have I done?

⛓️ Led end-to-end research, development, launch & maintenance of the Covalent decentralized ETL network coupled to a utility token staking programme for over USD 20 MIO in retail-owned CQT with 20+ 3rd party validators like ChorusOne, 1kx, Woodstock, Stakely.io, BwareLabs etc. The ["Block Specimen Product" (BSP)](https://github.com/covalenthq/bsp-geth) is an independent representation of blockchain state detached from the underlying chain database. Here a canonical unified data export schema is adopted across the blockchain industry for columnar packaging & storage of data generated from transactions execution (as blocks) for fully decentralized POS/POW networks. An [in-smart contract validating mechanism using cryptographic proofs](https://github.com/covalenthq/bsp-staking) ensures a staked [distributed set of validators](https://github.com/covalenthq/bsp-agent) performing the expected honest extraction and export. Penalties are imposed for not staying with live (or invalid) production of block specimens.

🗄️ Led design, specification, testing and deployment of a high granularity decentralized data transformation solution - [the "Refiner"](https://github.com/covalenthq/rudder) addressing blockchain data read scalability for EVM forks (Erigon, Go-Ethereum). Exported BSPs form the underlying layer through a [wrapped IPFS node](https://github.com/covalenthq/ipfs-pinner) forming a decentralized storage network. The manifest of all proofs can be read by anyone from a separate EVM public blockchain (soon the Covalent L1) that contains cryptographically validated content hashes for indexable refined chain data objects. The Refiner's Erlang runtime, being highly concurrent has soft real-time fault tolerance & high throughput, scaling transformations to 10x-20x on [finalized BSPs](https://github.com/covalenthq/bsp-finalizer).

💸 Led product design & backend development efforts on a USD [1 MIO project for Ethereum transaction fee predictions](https://www.theblock.co/post/67731/tokenization-startup-upvest-raises-1-million-to-develop-prediction-tool-for-ethereum-gas-fees) using deep neural networks from a POC to an API product scaled to up to 10 MIO calls per week resulting in 18% savings in crypto transfer costs for clients. Stack: Python 3, Jupyter, MongoDB (Atlas, Realm), Tensorflow, Node.JS; GCP, Cloud Functions, Tables & Scheduler.

💨 For a [digital assets (crypto) custody solution](https://upvest.co), co-authored a scalable transaction engine backend for up to 1000 txps using the Ethereum protocol within a microservices & events based architecture, this being the second most used client API developed at Upvest handling up to 10,000 txs within 2 days. Stack: Golang, TypeScript, Node.JS, Rabbitmq, MongoDB, Kubernetes, Docker, PostgreSQL, Github CI/CD workflows, APM.

👨‍🎓 Prior to moving into the software industry, I was devoted to (computational simulations) research and development at 6 international experimental nuclear fusion energy projects across Europe - Madrid (CIEMAT), Prague (IPP), Cadarache (CEA-ITER), and Lisbon (IPF), with significant portions at Max-Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (MPI) in Greifswald (Wendelstein-7X) & in Munich (ASDEX-UG) resulting in [authorship (and co-authorship) for over 20 papers within international nuclear fusion research journals](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rY5ZXHEAAAAJ&hl=en)
